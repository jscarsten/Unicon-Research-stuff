Questions
	Unicon is written in unicon? Does this mean that the translator "unicon" is written in Unicon the language?

	Need some clarity about what a language virtual machine is/does. I have some idea but It would help to be more clear

	In the book it says that programming languages that are the most difficult to implement are also those that differ most from each other. How does the comlexity of the implementation of Unicon/Icon differ from other languages.

	Would you say that easy of programming is inversly proportional to ease of implementation?

	Can you define your own custom user-defined operators in unicon, if no then why not? Languages like Haskell allow for this and other procedural languages allow for operator overloading like C++ and Python


Notes for Icon/Unicon implementation textbook

Preface
	- multiple compilers
		- icont/iconc
			- these are compilers that usuers use to traslate unicon code into machine 
			  code
				- iconc breaks icon code down to C code
				- icont breaks icon code down to virtaul machine code
			- a preprocessor called unicon translates unicon code into icon code which 
			  then compiles using iconc/
			- "unicon" is written in unicon
		- iconx
			- iconx is the name of the Unicon/Icon virtual machine
			- consists of a collection of high-level data-structure and I/O facilites,
			  which are built in to icon/unicon
		- rt.a
			- the runtime  library that is linked to Icon programs compiled with iconc
			- shared much of the code with iconx

Introduction
	- Implementing Programming Languages
		- in conventional programming languages most of the operations that are
		  performed upon execution can be determined statically by examining the code beforehand
		- also, most programming languages' operations closely correspond to the 
		  architecture of the computers on which they are executed
		- when these two conditions are met it is easy to map source code instructions 
		  to machine instructions for the computer to execute
		- this translation process is called compilation
		- in addition to a compiler most language implemetations include a run-time
		  component that contains subroutines for performing computations that are too complex to compile in-line, such as I/O and mathematical fucntions
		- some languages have features whose meanings change during program execution.
			- this makes these features unable to be determined statically from the 
  			  text of a source-language program 
  			- examples of these features are
  				- changing of fucntion meanings during execution
  				- creation of new data types at run-time
  				- self-modifying programs
  		- also some languages have features that do not match up with the architecture
  		  of conventional computers such as pattern matching
  		- in these cases it is impossible for a compiler to directly translate source 
  		  code into machine code
  		  - these cases increase the importance of the runtime system
  		- Icon is a language with much of these features
  			- this means that the implementation of Icon leans much more heavily on 
  			  the runtime system than the compiler

Icon Language Overview
	- Note: The implementer of a programming language needs a very different 
	  understanding of the langugage of the one using it
	- stuff I dont already know
		- type checking is performed furing execution and automatic type conversion is 
		  provided
		- several operations are polymorphic, doing different operations depending on 
		  the types of the arguments
		- strings and structures are created during execution rather than being 
		  declared and allocated during compilation
		- structures have pointer semantics, each element in a structure is
		  represented as a pointer to an object
		- storage management is automatic
		- memory allocation is handled by garbage collection behind the scenes
		- the only limits on the size of objects is the practical capabilites of the 
		  computer architecture 
		- Icon programs are consisted of records, procedures and global identifiers
		- Icon has no block structure
		- scoping is static, identifiers are either global or local to procedures
		- Icon is expression based and has reserved-word syntax
	- Data Types
		- int, float, strings, csets
		- no char data type
		- strings of characters are not arrays, they are their own data object
		- 4 structure types, that compromise an aggregate of values
			- list, record, table, set
		- null value
		- procedures are also data values
			- procedures can be assigned to variables, returned and passed to 
			  functions, etc
			- cannot create procedures during program execution
		- co-expressions are  also data types
			- they are the express ion level analog of coroutines
			- their importance comes from Icon's expression evaluation mechanism
		- during execution, type checking is performed
			- ex. i := x + 1
			- the value of x is checked to be sure that it is numeric, and if it isnt 
			  it attempts to convert it
			- if it cannot be converted then a runtime error will occur and the  
			  program will be terminated
		- Note: Icon uses the "numeric" type as either a real or integer number
	- Expression Evaluation
		- in most programming languages an expression always produces exactly 1 result
		- in Icon the evaluation of an expression may produce a single result, no 
		  result, or a sequence of results
		- an expression that does not produce a result is said to fail while an 
		  expression that produces a result succeeds
		- success and failure are used to manipulate the flow of the program
		- Icon has no Boolean type
		- Failure in Icon does not indicate an error instead it indicates that there 
		  was no result produced
		- if an expression enclosed in another expression fails, the internal 
		  expression produces no result and the outer expression cannot perform the computation and also fails
		- this inheritance of failure allows computations to be written concisely
		- some expressions produce variables while some produce values
		- co-expressions
			- due to the nature of unicon and co-expressions, there are many 
			  complexities in the implementation
			- if there were no co-expressions, then generators would produce results 
			  that are limited to a single space in the program, and also it's scope can be determined during program translation
	- one of icons notable characteristics is it's freedom from the 
	  translation-time constraints and the ability to specify and change meanings at runtime

Is icode the icon equivalent to bytecode? If so how is it different to say java bytecode that runs on JVM

Need some clarification about the null value descriptor representation. Is the n flag set? Is it just empty?

Are qualifiers treated as descriptors in blocks?
If yes then ... -->
So the location for the first descriptor in a block of a given type is supposed to be the same for all blocks with that type, but with records, therre may be any number of non-descriptor qualifiers that point to strings that appear before the "descriptor". In this case are qualifiers 

The book says that Block-Pointers can be placed anywhere before the descriptors but they must be in the same place for all blocks of that type. What does a block pointer point to?

Language Features and implementations
	- values and variables
		- the absence of type delcarations has far reaching
		  implications
		- since any variable can be any type and the types of
		  variables can change during execution, we must have a wasy to represent values uniformly
		  - this is esepcially significant since Icon/Unicon has a 
		    wide variety of variable types that can be represented
		- The solution is heterogeneous structures
		- in some way no type delcarations makes implementation 
		  easier meaning that some of the work that is conventionally done by compilers can be ignored
		- however the problem is not avoidable, it just goes to
		  another part of the implementation
		- automatic tpye conversion goes hand in hand with lack of
		  type declarations
	- storage management
		- since structures and strings are created during
		  execution, the space must be allocated at runtime
		- this implies a need for some garbage collection
		  mechanism that will reclaim allocated memory after that memeory is no longer needed
		- the problem is further complicated by the diversity of
		  types and sizes of objects, the lack of size limitations and possible circular pointer loops in structures
	- strings
		- the emphasis of Icon is string processing 
		- there is the need for a well designed and coherent 
		  mechanism for handling strings
	- structures
		- Icons unusual structures that have sophisticated access
		  mechanisms also pose problems
		- specifically structures that can grow without limit
		  require different iplementation approaches than static structures
		- the ability of lists to support stack, and queue 
		  mechanisms will compromise efficient access for other uses
		- sets with values that can have any type, that also
		  provide a collection of set operations pose problems
		- tables are similar to sets but they also need more
		  attention since they add elements in a special way
	- procedures and functions
		- procedures and functions are values and must be
		  represented as data objects
		- this means that the meaning of a function call cannot be 
		  determined during translation
		- ex. write(s) may write string s or it might not 
		  depending on whether or not write still has it's initial value 
		- therefore procedures must be determined at runtime
	- polymorphic operations
		- operations cannot be changes during execution, but most
		  arguments support polymorphic arguments (of many different types)
		- also different operators ay have different meanings for 
		  assignment or dereferenceing
			- ex. s[i] := "hi"
				  is a different operation than
				  write(s[i])
				  but it uses the smae operator
		- overall the context is impossible to determine at 
		  translation time
	- expression evaluation
		- generators and co-expressions present obvious
		  implementation problems
		- there is little knowledge in the area of expression
		  evaluation in which expressions can produce a series of results in sequence
		- moreover, generators and co-expression can be applied to
		  every context with every data type
		- therefore the implementatipon requires a new approach
		- efficiency is a concern in this area more than others
		- the mechanism that handles expression evaluation also
		  has to be able to handle conventional single-result expressions as well
	- co-expressions	
		- only relavant because of goal-directed execution /
		  expression evaluation of unicon
		- without co-expressions, generators are limited to the 
		  place where they execute in the program
		- with co-expressions, generators can be activated at any
		  point in a program past their declaration

Organization of the Implementation
	- many factors influence the implementation of a language
		- properties of the language, goals, reseources, etc
	- Icon was developed with ease of modification in mind
	- Icon was developed for machines that only had 128K bytes of 
	  address space
	- The Icon Virtual Machine
		- the icon implementation is organized around a VM
		- VMs serve as software design tools for implementations
		  in which the operations of a language do not fit a particular computer architecture
		- also VMs do well if protability is a concern
		- most VM models do some translation that will map the VM 
		  operations onto the real machine 
		- during the design and development of an implementation 
		  a VM can an idealized model in which the ideosyncrasies of any real machine can be ignored
		- Icon's Virtual Machine is incomplete, it only includes
		  the expression evaluation mechanism and the computations on Icon data 
        - many aspects of the Icon runtime system are not
          represented in the VM
        	- type checking, storage allocation, garbage   
        	  collection
        - Icon's VM serves more as a guide/tool for organizing the
          implementation rather than a rigid structure
    - Components of the Implementation
    	- 3 major components: translator, linker, runtime system
    	- these all fall under the virtual machine implementation
    	- logicaly the translator and linker are different but 
    	  they are compiled as 1 program
    	- Translator Overview
    		- plays the role of compiler for the Icon VM
    		- converts source code into virtual machine
    		  instructions
    		- translator output is called ucode
    		- ucode is represented in ASCII which is useful for 
    		  debugging
    	- Linker Overview
    		- combines one or more ucode files into a single file 
    		  for the VM
    			- this allows programs to be written in multiple 
    		  	  modules
    		  	- also useful for giving users access to 
    		  	  pre-translated Icon libraries
    		- output of linker is called icode
    		- icode is represented in binary format
    		- ucode and icode are essentially the same just in a
    		  different format
    	- the process looks like this

    Icon program --> [ translator ] --> ucode [ linker ] --> icode

    	- these phases can be done seperately, if only phase 1
    	  happens you get ucode, which can be linked later
    	- the runtime system consists of an interpreter for icode
    	  and a library of support routines to carry out the various operations that may occur when an Icon program is executed
    	- the interpreter is the software realization of the Icon 
    	  VM
    - The Translator
    	- written in C
    	- independent of the architecture of the target machine
    	- ucode is portable
    	- consists of : lexical analyzer, parser, code generator, 
    	  a few support routines
    	- lexical analyzer converts a source program into a
    	  stream of tokens provided to the parser as needed
    	- the parser generates abtract syntax trees on a per
    	  procedure basis
    	- the syntax trees are then passed to the code generator 
    	  and converted to ucode
    	- the parser is generated automatically by Yacc from a 
    	  grammatical specification
    	- in the body of an icon procedure, a series of
    	  expressions are seperated by semicolons.
    	- these semicolons need not be provided explicitly
    	- the lexical analyzer can do automatic semicolon 
    	  insertion if a line ends with a token that legally ends
    	  an expression and the beginning of the next line starts with a token that can legally start an expression 
    	- if an expression spans 2 lines then the place to put 
    	  the semicolon is the first legal token to appear
    - The Linker
    	- the linker reads ucode files and writes icode files
    	- icode files starts with an executable header that loads
    	  the runtime system
    	- the rest of an icode file consists of file information,
    	  operations codes and operands, and data specific to that program
    	- the linker is written in C
    	- conversion from ucode to icode is mainly reformatting
    	- the linker does 2 other things besides icode conversion
		- scope resolution
			- if an identifier in a procedure is undeclared,
			  it's scope is dependent on global (explicit/implicit) delcarations in the program
			- the translator only can operate on 1 module of a
			  program at a time, so it cannot resolve the scope of undeclared identifiers
			- this is because not all global scope information is
			  contained in 1 module
			- the linker handles all the modules so it can
			  resolve the scope of these identifiers
			- an identifier may be global for several reasons
				- explicit global declaration
				- name in a record declaration
				- name in a procedure declaration
				- name of a built in function
			- if an identifier with no local delcaration falls
			  into 1 of these catagories, it is global, otherwise it is local
		- construction of runtime structures
			- a number of aspects of an icon program are
			  represented at runtime by various data structures
				- procedure blocks, strings, blocks for csets, and
				  real literals 
				- the ucode that represents this information is
				  machine-independent
				- the linker converts the information into the
				  appropriate format for the machine architecture
	- The Runtime System
		- the runtime system is mostly written in C, with a 
		  little assembly
		- there are 2 main reasons to concetrate most of the
		  implementation in the runtime system 
			- some icon features do not translate well directly
			  into executable code, since there is not a direct 
			  image for them in the target-machine's architecture. Therefore the target machine code necessary to carry out these operations would be too big to put in-line. Instead it is placed in the library routines called from the in-line code
				- examples include structure operations and 
				  string scanning
			- operations that cannot be determined at translation
			  time must be determined at runtime. 
				- examples of this include type checking to
				  string scanning to structure operations
		- there are 4 main logical parts of the runtime system
			- initialization and termination routines
				- init routine sets up regions in which objects 
				  created at runtime are allocated
				- init routine also initalizes some structures
				  that are used during program execution
				- after these tasks are done, control is 
				  transferred to the interpreter
				- when a program terminates in any way,
				  termination routines will flush all the output buffers and return control to the OS
			- the interpreter
				- the interpreter analyzes icode instructions and
				  their operands and performs the corresponding operations
				- the interpreter is not very complex, most
				  complex operations are performed by the library routines
			- the library routines
				- they are divided into 3 main catagories, Icon 
				  operator routines, Icon built in function routines, routines for complicated Icon VM operations
				- the meanings of operators are known to the 
				  translator/linker so they can be called directly
				- functions however cannot be determined until
				  they are executed, so functions are called indirectly
			- the support routines
				- include storage allocation and garbage
				  collection, type checking, conversion
				- normally, support routines are called by the 
				  library routines

Values and Variables
	- the features that has the greatest impact on the icon
	  implementation is untyped variables
	- the downside to untyped variables is that it makes it
	  impossible for the translator to catch type errors until runtime
	- also a person who is writing or reading an Icon program
	  does not have type declarations to help them clarify the programs intent
	- type checking and coversion are intertwined in the
	  implementation
	- untyped variables simplify the translator and complicate
	  the runtime system
	- since any variable can have any type of value at any time,
	  all values must have the same size
		- the problem to this solution is the descriptor, which
		  either contains the data, if it is small enough, or a pointer to the data
	- Descriptors
		- Every Icon value is represented by a descriptor
		- Icon descriptors must be small as possible, while also
		  containing enough informationto determine the type of the value and locate the actual data
		- descriptors are composed of "words"
		- one word is not large enough to contain both the type 
		  information and the integer/pointer
		- so descriptors are made of 2 words, called the d-word, 
		  and the v-word
			- the d-word contains descritpive info
			- the v-word contains the value
		- different computer arhcitectures may have different
		  sizes for words and integers/pointers may not necessarily be the same size
			- Icon is mainly concerned with 32/64 bit 
			  architectures
			- also the large memory model in which pointers are
			  larger than integers, in this case the v-word must accommodate the largest of the types
		- d-words contain a type code, which is an integer, in 
		  their least significant bits, and flags in their most significant bits
		- there are 12 different type codes
			- data type | type code
			  null	      null
			  int 		  int or long
			  real num    real
			  cset    	  cset
			  file  	  file
			  procedure   proc
			  list 		  list
			  set 		  set
			  table 	  table
			  record	  record
			  co-expr  	  coexpr

			- there are other type codes for internal objects but 
			  they are not visible at the soruce-language level 
	- Strings
		- there is not type code for strings
		- they have a special representation where the d-word
		  contains the length of the string and the v-word points to the first character 
		- string descriptors are called qualifiers
		- in order to distinguish qualifiers from other
		  descriptors wiht type codes that are the same as the string length, all descriptors that are not qualifiers have an n flag in the MSB of the d-word
		- the d-words of qualifiers do not have the n flag and 
		  string lengths are prevented from overflowing into that flag's posiiton
	- Integers
		- Icon supports integers up to 32 bits in size 
		- as long as it fits, the value of an icon integer is 
		  stored in the v-word
		- integers are represented by 2 different type codes
			- integer for integers that are contained in v-words
			- lrgint for integers that are contained in blocks 
			  pointed to by the v-words of their descriptors
	- Blocks
		- blocks are what icon data is stored in when the v-word 
		  cannot hold the value
		- the first word of every block is called the title and
		  it contains a type code that is the same code in the d-word in the descriptor 
		- some blocks are fixed in size for all values of a given 
		  type
		- the p flag in the descriptor indicates that the v-word 
		  contains a pointer to a block
		- some other blocks have varying sizes for other types, 
		  like records
		- a block will never grow or shrink in size
		- if the type code in the title does not determine the
		  size of the block, the second word in the block contains it's size in bytes
		- many blocks contain an id field that is used to
		  distinguish between different blocks of the same type
		  	- the runtime system maintains seperate id counters
		  	  for blocks of different types
		- blocks may contain descriptors as well as 
		  non-descriptors like qualifiers
		  	- an example is record blocks which may contain
		  	  different data types for each field
		- non-descriptor data comes first in a block before the
		  descriptor data
		- the first descriptor in a block is constant for all
		  blocks of a given type, which helps with garbage collection
	- Variables
		- variables are also represented with descriptors just 
		  like values
		- variables to identifiers point to descriptors for the 
		  corresonding values
		- variable descriptors never point to other variable 
		  descriptors, always to value descriptors 
		- the v flag indicates that the descriptor is for a 
		  variable
		- the values of local identifiers are kept on a program
		  stack while static/global identifiers are kept in fixed locations in memory
		- a variable that references some value in a data 
		  structure references the start of the data structure and the least significant bits of the d-word will contain an offset (in words, not bytes) to the value you want to reference
		- Operations on variables
			- variables can be used in 2 fundamental contexts
			  dereferencing and assignment
			- for example the instruction write(s) for some
			  string s calls for the variable descriptor s to fetch the value descriptor holding "hello" that it is pointing to. This is dereferencing
			- say you also want to assign s := 13570. The value 
			  descriptor pointed to by the v word of the variable descriptor changes
